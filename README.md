# PredictCreditApproval

This is a relatively simple Python notebook that explores the credit card approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. To protect the confidentiality of this data, all the attribute names and values have been obfuscated.

This isn't an example of an exhaustive approach to analysing the data. Instead it is a simple and easy to understand approach to the concepts of data cleaning, visualisation, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. At the end of the notebook there are suggestions for the learner to further improve on the project themselves.
